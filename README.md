✨ *“Code is poetry, and hardware is the canvas.”*  
```

This README highlights:

* **Your skills & tech stack**
* **Biggest projects you’ve built (from our past chats!)**
* **Dynamic GitHub stats** (auto-updates)
* **A touch of personality with a tagline**

Would you like me to also design a **dark-themed ASCII banner logo** (e.g. `0joseDark`) at the top of the README so it feels even more personal?
